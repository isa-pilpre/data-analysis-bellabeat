# Chapter 2: Prepare Phase

## 1. Data Sources

For this analysis, I will be using the **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** (<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit>) from Kaggle (CC0: Public Domain). 
This dataset includes data from 30 Fitbit users who have agreed to provide their personal fitness tracker information, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. 
The dataset provides insights into users' daily habits, such as steps taken, activity levels, and sleep patterns.

More precisely, as it stated in <https://zenodo.org/records/53894#.X9oeh3Uzaao>, 
"datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016."  
Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B).  
Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.  

However, it is important to note that this dataset has limitations: 
* the sample siez is small (30 users),
* the data is fairly outdated (2016), and
* there may be possible biases in the type of users who agreed to participate. 

To make my analysis more robust, fair and relevant, I do need to look for additional datasets.

## 2. Data Organization

The data is organized in **wide format**, with each row representing a specific day for each user, and columns containing various measurements such as daily steps, activity levels, and heart rate.

## 3. Data Storage

The dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle and is stored locally on my compter in a dedicated Bellabeat project folder. 
I have also uploaded a copy to my GitHub repository for version control throughout the project.

## 4. Credibility and Bias Considerations

While the dataset is publicly available and contains valuable information, it does have limitations that could introduce bias:

- The sample size is small, with only 30 participants, which does not provide a full representation of the general population, not by any stretch of the imagination.
- The participants might not be representative of the average Fitbit user, so data might be skewed.

To ensure the data meets the **ROCCC** standards (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited), I will:

- Review the dataset for any inconsistencies or missing values.
- Look for additional datasets in order to a broader and fairer view of smart device usage.

## 5. Privacy, Security, and Licensing

Since this dataset is part of the **public domain (CC0 license)**, it is free to use for analysis without legal restrictions. 
I will make sure that the data is handled securely and responsibly. 
No personal or identifiable information is included in this dataset, so privacy concerns are minimal.

## 6. Data Integrity

To verify the dataâ€™s integrity, I will:

- Check for missing, duplicated, or inconsistent entries.
- Validate that the measurements (such as steps, activity levels, and heart rates) are within realistic ranges.
- Make sure that all date formats and timestamps are correct and consistent.

## 7. How the Data Helps Answer the Questions

This dataset (among with other datasets that I will find) is central to answering the key questions for Bellabeat. 
By analyzing trends in fitness tracker usage, I can provide insights into how people use smart devices like Fitbit for their health and wellness. 
These insights will help Bellabeat better understand its target audience and refine its marketing strategy.

## 8. Problems with the Data

A few issues to consider:

- The small sample size prevents from making any general, definitive conclusions on the findings.
- The dataset only includes users who agreed to share their data, so the data might have self-selection bias.
- There may be missing or incomplete data points that need to be addressed during the cleaning process.
