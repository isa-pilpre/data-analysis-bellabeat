# Chapter 3: Process & Clean phase (Fitbit)

With the Fitbit dataset now organized and stored in the `Fitbit_Complete_Data` folder, the next step is to assess the data's structure, check for anomalies (nulls, duplicates, out-of-range values, outliers), and clean it when necessary.

## 1) Reminder of the business task

To stay aligned with the business task, I need to remember the following key questions:
   
- What are some trends in smart device usage?
- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?


## 2) Reminder of the 18 files

The Fitbit dataset contains the following 18 files:

combined_dailyActivity_merged.csv
combined_heartrate_seconds_merged.csv
combined_hourlyCalories_merged.csv
combined_hourlyIntensities_merged.csv
combined_hourlySteps_merged.csv
combined_minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv
combined_minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv
combined_minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv
combined_minuteSleep_merged.csv
combined_minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv
combined_weightLogInfo_merged.csv
dailyCalories_merged.csv
dailyIntensities_merged.csv
dailySteps_merged.csv
minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv
minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv
minuteStepsWide_merged.csv
sleepDay_merged.csv


## 3) Initial overview of the data

Before cleaning, I performed a basic overview of all the .csv files to understand their structure, column names, data types, etc. 

Sample code:

```r
# Loop through all .csv files and save summaries to the overview file
for (file in all_files) {
  data <- read_csv(file)
 
  # Capture summary output
  summary_output <- capture.output({
   
    cat("File: ", basename(file), "\n")
    print((head(data)))                          # displays a tibble (first few lines & columns)
    print(str(data))                             # structure with data types
    cat("Column names: ", colnames(data), "\n")  # column names
    print(summary(data))                         # summary w/ min, max, mean, median & quartiles
    cat("\n---------------------------------\n")
  })
 
  # Write summary to the overview file
  write(summary_output, overview_file, append = TRUE)
}

```

### What I gathered from the `Overview.txt` file



## 4) Data cleaning and quality checks (nulls, duplicates, range validation)

The following R script focuses specifically on:
- Checking NAs
- Removing duplicates
- Identifying and handling outliers


Sample code:
```r
# Goal: Check for NAs, duplicates, outliers

# Loop through all CSV files and clean data
for (file in all_files) {
  data <- read_csv(file)

  # Count missing (NA) values for each column
  na_count <- colSums(is.na(data))
  print(paste("Missing values in file", basename(file), ":"))
  print(na_count)

  # Check for duplicates based on relevant columns
  data <- data %>% distinct()  # Remove any duplicate rows
  
  # Add outlier detection here if necessary

  # Save the cleaned data or output cleaning info as needed
}

```

## 6) Double-checking and validation
