# Chapter 1: Ask Phase

## 1. Context

Welcome to my data analysis case study for Bellabeat company. 

In this case study, let's assume I am working as a Data Analyst for [Bellabeat](<http://www.bellabeat.com>), a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women.

## 2. Business task

Bellabeat has asked me to analyze public data from a competitor's smart devices (**FitBit Fitness Tracker Data**) to better understand how people use their wearables. The CCO also suggested that I should look for **a complementary public dataset** to make the analyst more robust and relevant.

The goal is to apply the insights I gather from these datasets to Bellabeat’s products, in order to provide recommendations that will help shape the company’s marketing strategy. Ultimately, this will help increase customer engagement and improve retention.

## 3. Stakeholders

The key stakeholders in this project are:

- **Urška Sršen**: Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer at Bellabeat, who is looking for data insights to support the company's growth.
- **Sando Mur**: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder, a key member of the Bellabeat executive team.
- **Bellabeat Marketing Team**: They will use these insights to adjust their marketing strategy and better connect with customers.

Given the different profiles of these stakeholders, I will likely need to tailor my findings and visuals based on my audience. Urška Sršen, with her creative background, may appreciate more high-level and conceptual insights, while Sando Mur may prefer more technical, data-driven results. The Marketing Team will likely benefit from actionable insights and user-friendly visuals to easily adapt their strategies.

These stakeholders will use the analysis results to make informed, data-driven decisions for Bellabeat's marketing and product strategies.

## 4. Key questions

My analysis will focus on answering the following questions:

**What trends in smart device usage can be identified from the available data?**
Although the FitBit dataset is from 2016, what patterns can still offer valuable insights?

**How can these trends be relevant to Bellabeat's customers today?**
What insights from the competitor’s data can help Bellabeat better understand their own users?

**How can these insights help shape Bellabeat's marketing strategy?**
How can the identified patterns guide the marketing team to improve customer engagement and boost sales?
