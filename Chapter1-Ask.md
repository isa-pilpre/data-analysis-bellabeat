# Chapter 1: Ask phase

## 1. Context

This is a data analysis case study for [Bellabeat](<http://www.bellabeat.com>), a fem-tech company specializing in health jewelry trackers. Bellabeat products track daily activity (e.g. steps), heart rate, sleep cycles, menstrual cycles, and more.

## 2. Business Task

The goal is to **analyze smart device data to identify trends and provide actionable marketing strategies for Bellabeat**. 

Bellabeat’s Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen, has asked me to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data. The goal is to uncover user behavior patterns that can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy and identify growth opportunities. 

What do they mean by "smart device data"? 

- **Activity trends**: How many steps do users walk per day, at what time of the day, on which day of the week, when do they rest the most, etc.?
- **Demographics**: What are the key demographic segments (age, employment, with a focus on women)?
- **Consumer sentiment**: How do users feel about their smart device?


## 3. Stakeholders

The key stakeholders in this project are:

- **Urška Sršen**: Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer at Bellabeat, who is looking for data insights to support the company's growth.
- **Sando Mur**: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder, a core member of Bellabeat executive team.
- **Bellabeat Marketing Team**: They will use these insights to refine their marketing strategy and better connect with customers.

Given their diverse profiles, I will tailor my findings and visuals to meet their needs: 

- Urška Sršen, with her creative background, may appreciate **high-level insights** and very **appealing visualizations** (I will create a Google Slides report with a **Bellabeat color theme** and **high-level recommendations**).

- Sando Mur may prefer **more technical, data-driven results** (I will provide him with this **technical report from Github**). 

- The **Marketing Team** will likely benefit from actionable insights and user-friendly visuals to easily adapt their strategies (the **Google Slides report** will have **clear and actionable insights**).
