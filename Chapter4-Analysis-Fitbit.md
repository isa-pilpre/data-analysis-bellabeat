# Chapter 4: Analysis phase (Fitbit)

Now that the Fitbit dataset is cleaned and stored in the `Cleaned_Fitbit` folder, it's time to start the actual data analysis.

## 1) Reminder of the business task

To stay aligned with the business task, I need to keep in mind the following key questions:
   
- What are some trends in smart device usage?
- How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
- How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## 2) Approach to the analysis

From the last step (Process phase), after I reviewed the tibbles, structures, summaries and column names of the 18 files, I found several possible trends that could emerge from the dataset:

- Activity trends: when users are most active (morning, afternoon, evening) based on the `ActivityHour` column. 
- Intensity trends: when users' activity is more or less intense based on `VeryActiveMinutes`, `FairlyActiveMinutes`, etc. columns.
- Sleep patterns: sleep duration and habits based on the `TotalMinutesAsleep` and `TotalTimeInBed` columns.
- Recovery patterns: heart rate patterns based on `Value` column in the heart rate file.

Let's upload the 18 files to BigQuery and run SQL queries to explore them. While I could stay in R for the entire analysis, I feel more comfortable running SQL queries first, then exporting the results as .csv files to my local drive for further analysis and then plotting in R.


## 3) First steps in BigQuery

### Creating a dataset

After accessing BigQuery, I selected my working project (`alien-oarlock-428016-f3`) in the left-hand navigation panel.
On the right of the project name, I clicked on the 3 dots and select `Create dataset`.
In the dialog box that appeared, I typed `bellabeat` in the `Dataset ID`, chose `Multi-region EU` for the `Location`, left the other settings at their default values, and then clicked `Create Dataset`.

### Creating tables

Once my dataset bellabeat was created, right on the dataset name, I clicked the three dots again and selected `Create table`. I began uploading the CSV files from my local `Cleaned_Fitbit` folder to BigQuery, one file at a time. The uploads for the daily activity, daily steps, and daily intensity files went smoothly. However, I encountered an error for the heart rate file (exceeded 100MB). 

### Handling large files with Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

Because the heart rate file was too big (over 100MB), I could not upload it directly to BigQuery. Instead, I used Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to handle the file. Since GCS is part of the same platform as BigQuery, itâ€™s very convenient.

I navigated to Cloud Storage from the left-hand Explorer pane, then clicked `CREATE BUCKET`. After making sure I was in the correct project (check the drop-down at the top of the screen), I named my bucket `bellabeat-proj`.

I selected `Multi-region EU` for the `Location` and kept the other settings as defaults before clicking `Create`.

With my bucket `bellabeat-proj` created, I uploaded the heart rate .csv file by selecting UPLOAD / Upload files on my bucket page.

Finally, I went back to BigQuery Studio. From the left-hand Explorer pane, I navigated to my project and dataset, clicked on the three dots, and selected `Create table`. I was able to browse to my bucket in Google Cloud Studio and import the heart rate file as a new table named `heartrate`.


## 4) Analyzing specific trends with SQL and then R

With most of the CSV files now uploaded as tables in BigQuery, I can begin analyzing the data using SQL queries.

### Daily steps versus time of the day (distinguishing weekdays and weekend)

I started by running an SQL query in BigQuery:

```sql
SELECT
  Id,
  DATE(TIMESTAMP(ActivityHour)) AS ActivityDate,  -- Extract the day
  CASE
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMP(ActivityHour)) BETWEEN 6 AND 11 THEN 'Morning'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMP(ActivityHour)) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMP(ActivityHour)) BETWEEN 18 AND 23 THEN 'Evening'
    ELSE 'Night'
  END AS PeriodOfDay,
  SUM(StepTotal) AS TotalSteps
FROM
  `alien-oarlock-428016-f3.bellabeat.hourly_steps`
GROUP BY
  Id, ActivityDate, PeriodOfDay
ORDER BY
  Id, ActivityDate, PeriodOfDay;
```

After that, I exported the `BigQuery_daily_steps.csv` file to my local `BigQuery_Exports` folder.
Next, I analyzed the .csv file further in R and created a visualization.

Sample R code:
```R
# Goal: plot BigQuery dataframe (daily steps by time of the day, distinguishing weekdays and weekend)

# Define path to csv file
csv_file <- here("DATA", "Fitbit", "BigQuery_Exports", "BigQuery_daily_steps.csv")

fitbit_steps <- read_csv(csv_file)

# Inspect the data
glimpse(fitbit_steps)

# Make sure the columns are in the right format
fitbit_steps <- fitbit_steps %>%
  mutate(
    ActivityDate = as.Date(ActivityDate, format = "%Y-%m-%d"),  # Ensure the date is in Date format
    PeriodOfDay = factor(PeriodOfDay, levels = c("Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening", "Night"))  # Period order
  )

# Add a column is_weekend
fitbit_steps <- fitbit_steps %>%
  mutate(is_weekend = if_else(wday(ActivityDate, week_start = 1) %in% c(6, 7), "Weekend", "Weekday"))

# Inspect new column
glimpse(fitbit_steps)

ggplot(fitbit_steps, aes(x = PeriodOfDay, y = TotalSteps, fill = is_weekend)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total Steps by Time of Day (Weekday vs Weekend)",
       x = "Period of Day",
       y = "Total Steps") +
  facet_wrap(~ is_weekend) +  # Facet by Weekend vs Weekday
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)  # Tilt x-axis labels for readability
  )

```


### Average intensity versus time of the day (distinguishing weekdays and weekend)

Again, I started by running an SQL query in BigQuery:

```sql
SELECT
  Id,
  DATE(TIMESTAMP(ActivityHour)) AS ActivityDate,  -- Extract the day
  CASE
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMP(ActivityHour)) BETWEEN 6 AND 11 THEN 'Morning'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMP(ActivityHour)) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMP(ActivityHour)) BETWEEN 18 AND 23 THEN 'Evening'
    ELSE 'Night'
  END AS PeriodOfDay,
  ROUND(AVG(AverageIntensity), 2) AS Avg_Intensity_Period -- calculate the average per period
FROM
  `alien-oarlock-428016-f3.bellabeat.hourly_intensity`
GROUP BY
  Id, ActivityDate, PeriodOfDay
ORDER BY
  Id, ActivityDate, PeriodOfDay; 
```
After that, I exported the `BigQuery_daily_average_intensity.csv` file to my local `BigQuery_Exports` folder.
Next, I analyzed the .csv file further in R and created a visualization.

Sample R code:
```R
# Goal: plot BigQuery dataframe (average intensity by time of the day, distinguishing weekdays and weekend)

# Define path to csv file
csv_file <- here("DATA", "Fitbit", "BigQuery_Exports", "BigQuery_daily_average_intensity.csv")

fitbit_avg_intensity <- read_csv(csv_file)

# Inspect the data
glimpse(fitbit_avg_intensity)

# Make sure columns are in the right format
fitbit_avg_intensity <- fitbit_avg_intensity %>%
  mutate(
    ActivityDate = as.Date(ActivityDate, format = "%Y-%m-%d"),  # Make sure the date is in Date format
    PeriodOfDay = factor(PeriodOfDay, levels = c("Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening", "Night"))  # Period order
  )

# Add a column is_weekend
fitbit_avg_intensity <- fitbit_avg_intensity %>%
  mutate(is_weekend = if_else(wday(ActivityDate, week_start = 1) %in% c(6, 7), "Weekend", "Weekday"))

# Inspect new column
glimpse(fitbit_avg_intensity)

# Plot with facets weekdays/weekend
ggplot(fitbit_intensity, aes(x = PeriodOfDay, y = Sum_Average_Intensity, fill = is_weekend)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Intensity by Time of Day (Weekday vs Weekend)",
       x = "Period of Day",
       y = "Average Intensity") +
  facet_wrap(~ is_weekend) +  # Facet by Weekend vs Weekday
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)  # Tilt x-axis labels for readability
  )

```



### Sleep (sleep duration and time in bed) versus steps

I started by running an SQL query in BigQuery:

``` sql
SELECT 
    steps.Id, 
    steps.ActivityDay, 
    steps.StepTotal,  -- below: FLOOR() to extract hour, MOD() to extract minutes
    CONCAT(FLOOR(sleep.TotalMinutesAsleep / 60), "h ", MOD(sleep.TotalMinutesAsleep, 60), "min") AS TotalSleepDuration, 
    CONCAT(FLOOR(sleep.TotalTimeInBed / 60), "h ", MOD(sleep.TotalTimeInBed, 60), "min") AS TotalTimeInBedDuration, 
    ROUND((sleep.TotalMinutesAsleep / sleep.TotalTimeInBed) * 100, 2) AS SleepEfficiencyPercent
FROM 
    `alien-oarlock-428016-f3.bellabeat.daily_steps` AS steps
JOIN 
    `alien-oarlock-428016-f3.bellabeat.sleep_day` AS sleep
ON 
    steps.Id = sleep.Id  -- Join on the same user
AND 
    DATE(steps.ActivityDay) = DATE(sleep.SleepDay)  -- Join on the same day
ORDER BY 
    steps.Id, steps.ActivityDay;

```

After that, I exported the `BigQuery_sleep_versus_steps.csv` file to my local `BigQuery_Exports` folder.
Next, I analyzed the .csv file further in R and created a visualization.

Sample R code:
```R
# Goal: plot BigQuery dataframe (Sleep Duration versus Daily Steps)

# Define path to csv file
csv_file <- here("DATA", "Fitbit", "BigQuery_Exports", "BigQuery_sleep_versus_steps.csv")

fitbit_steps_sleep <- read_csv(csv_file)

# Inspect the data
glimpse(fitbit_steps_sleep)

# Convert 'TotalSleepDuration' from "Xh Ymin" format to total hours
fitbit_steps_sleep <- fitbit_steps_sleep %>%
  mutate(TotalSleepHours = as.numeric(gsub("h.*", "", TotalSleepDuration)) +  # Extract hours
           as.numeric(gsub(".*h |min", "", TotalSleepDuration)) / 60)          # Extract minutes and convert to hours

# Inspect the new column
glimpse(fitbit_steps_sleep)

# Create the plot to show relationship between steps and sleep (with 'TotalSleepHours' column to make it work)
ggplot(fitbit_steps_sleep, aes(x = StepTotal, y = TotalSleepHours)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = TotalSleepHours)) +  # Scatter plot with color based on 'TotalSleepHours'
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +  # Add a trend line
  labs(title = "Relationship between Sleep Duration and Daily Steps",
       x = "Total Steps",
       y = "Sleep Duration (hours)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)  # Tilt x-axis labels for readability
  )
```

### Very active minutes versus calories spent

SQL query in BigQuery:

``` sql
SELECT 
  Id, 
  ActivityDate, 
  SUM(VeryActiveMinutes) AS TotalVeryActiveMinutes, 
  SUM(Calories) AS TotalCalories
FROM 
  `alien-oarlock-428016-f3.bellabeat.daily_activity`
GROUP BY 
  Id, ActivityDate
ORDER BY 
  TotalVeryActiveMinutes DESC;

```

After that, I exported the `BigQuery_very_active_vs_calories.csv` file to my local `BigQuery_Exports` folder.
Next, I analyzed the .csv file further in R and created a visualization.

Sample R code:
```R
# Goal: Plot the relationship between Very Active Minutes and Calories burned

# Define path to the csv file
csv_file <- here("DATA", "Fitbit", "BigQuery_Exports", "BigQuery_very_active_vs_calories.csv")

# Load the CSV file
fitbit_active_vs_calories <- read_csv(csv_file)

# Inspect the data
glimpse(fitbit_active_vs_calories)

# Ensure ActivityDate is in Date format
fitbit_active_vs_calories <- fitbit_active_vs_calories %>%
  mutate(ActivityDate = as.Date(ActivityDate, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))

# Inspect the data
glimpse(fitbit_active_vs_calories)

# Create the plot to show the relationship between Very Active Minutes and Calories
ggplot(fitbit_active_vs_calories, aes(x = TotalVeryActiveMinutes, y = TotalCalories)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = TotalCalories)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Very Active Minutes vs Calories Burned", x = "Very Active Minutes", y = "Calories") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```


### Heart rate versus steps

First I ran an SQL query in BigQuery:

``` sql
-- Calculates the average heart rate (AVG(Value)) for each user (Id) per day (ActivityDay).
WITH avg_heart_rate AS (   

   SELECT 
   Id,
   DATE(TIMESTAMP(Time)) as ActivityDay,  -- get only the day from TIMESTAMP
   avg(Value) as AvgHeartRate  -- Calculate average heart rate per day
   
   FROM 
      `alien-oarlock-428016-f3.bellabeat.heartrate`
   GROUP BY 
      Id, ActivityDay
)


SELECT

steps.Id,
steps.StepTotal,
ROUND(avg_heart_rate.AvgHeartRate, 1) as AverageHeartRate

FROM `alien-oarlock-428016-f3.bellabeat.daily_steps` as steps
JOIN avg_heart_rate

ON 
  steps.Id = avg_heart_rate.Id
AND 
  steps.ActivityDay = avg_heart_rate.ActivityDay

ORDER BY 
  steps.Id, steps.ActivityDay ;
```

After that, I exported the `BigQuery_heartrate_versus_steps.csv` file to my local `BigQuery_Exports` folder.
Next, I analyzed the .csv file further in R and created a visualization.

Sample R code:
```R
